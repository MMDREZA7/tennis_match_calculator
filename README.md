# Tennis Match App 🎾

Tennis Match App is a simple tool for tracking friendly tennis matches in small groups. It is especially useful when you have 3 or more players and want to know who has played the most and who is performing better over time.

---

## Main features

- Designed for groups of **3+ players**; each player has stats for total games, wins, losses, and win rate.
- Matches can be recorded from both the **Home** screen and the **Settings** screen.
- All completed matches are stored in **History**, where you can review results for each tournament or day.

---

## Star player system

- In one‑on‑one matches, if a player manages to beat **every other registered player** in a single round, they earn a ⭐ star.
- Every time they repeat this full sweep, one more star is added next to their name on the player list.

---

## Recording matches

- On the **Home** screen you select who is playing today and tap **Record Game** to enter the score.
- In the score dialog you can:
  - Choose the winner and loser.
  - Set the score (for example, 50 – Love).
  - Toggle whether the match was won by **Deuce**.

---

## Settings and reset options

- From the **Settings** screen you can reset data using the **Reset all data** button.
- After pressing reset, you can choose what to delete:
  - Players
  - Matches
  - Histories
  - And whether the current match on the Home screen should be saved to History before wiping data.

---

## History and filtering

- The **History** tab shows each tournament/day with its date, number of players, and number of matches.
- Inside a history entry you can:
  - See each player’s stats (games, wins, losses, win rate).
  - See the full list of matches with opponents and scores.
  - Tap on a player to **filter matches only for that player**, making it easy to see who they played and how each match ended.
